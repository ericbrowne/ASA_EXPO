  Note 1:  A margin of error (MOE) is the difference between an estimate and its upper
  or lower confidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created by adding the margin   
  of error to the estimate (for an upper bound) and subtracting the margin of error   
  from the estimate (for a lower bound). All published margins of error for the Small 
  Area Health Insurance Estimates program are based on a 90 percent confidence level. 
 
  Note 2:  The number in a demographic group is the number of people in the poverty   
  universe in that age
 
  Note 3:  Values for Kalawao
 
  Note 4:  MOEs of zero should be assumed to be <1 for counts and <0.1 for percentages.
 
  General Note:  Details may not sum to totals because of rounding.
