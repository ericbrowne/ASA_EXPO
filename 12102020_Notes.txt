notes:

be sure that county level is actually attainable
PUMAS rather than counties, double check that its county level and not PUMA

+ Awkard Timing:
	++ Right now, we are preparing an abstract, for something that is readily changing
	++ Either Choosing an analysis thats still relevant in August, still policy implications 
		+++ Or choosing an analysis, mix and match things.  Choose an analysis thats still predictive in August, or predicting things that could be a thing/apparent in September
		+++ Or a mix of things, "What happens next".
		+++ Or do analyses, "I didnt peak", lets predict April 2021 from data available through January, or lets predict March 2021 from data available through January 2021
			+++ Picking a model and refining it
			+++ Prediction is hard, especially the future
		+++ Alternatively, also have analyses where its rapped up
			++ "" Relationship between between employment and vuneralbility stats"" totally made up, but an example (Self contained)

+ ACS (Core Dataset)
	++ A lot of variables (about 40)
	++ 
+ For Practice for next Time:  
	++ Have a look at what ACS variables predict SVI (If its at county level, so be it, but look at state level)
	++ Another thing thats going to be necessasry, is understanding the error terms, and the data collection proccess, decide how the error terms would propagate though the dataset/models
	++ Data on other topics, things that might affect the employment, for example is the extent to which the counties would be shut down at each time
		++ Might be hard at certain times, some very serious webscraping
	++ Take a look at what datasets could be interesting and show Cathy
