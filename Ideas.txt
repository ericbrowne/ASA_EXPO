ASA Expo Project Ideas:

1. Disease Spread Prediction:  Number of Deaths and Cases
+ Predictors: Lockdown dummy variables, Population Density, Median Age of affected areas
+ Could Also try a Graph analysis



2. COVID disproportionate to certain income levels?
+ Are certain income demographics more susecptible to COVID19

3. Which sectors are most affected by job loss? Classification problem?

+ Are certain states more affected by job loss that others?
+ Classification on whether or not a certain job sector/state will lose a certain number of jobs
+ Predicting how many jobs per capita in a given sector a given state will lose over the next month? year?



4. Measuring overall health of a state over time as COVID spreads


5. Predicting which job sectors/states will survive the pandemic or sustain their economy above a certain threshold



## Hinton ML class course era
# JSM International
# Independent Study with Cathy
# Winter Break time to go hard

# Files can be JSON or CSV (levels of disaggregation? Big files!)
# IPUMP Interface for datasets
# Query yourself in aggregation
	# Adjusting Analysis Accordingly
	# Something to direct analysis of the API

# Challenge for Prediction: Whether time youre predicting for resembles current time
	+ Explanatory variables change over time?
		+ Need to predict those, or come up with a range of values for those variables as well as dependent variable
	+ Predicting demand for hostpital services



# Potential for retrospective analyses:
	+ Which national policies were most effective?
		+ Might be something to work in:
	+ Fallback?
	+ Can start with prediction, get a running start
		+ Get base data (jan2020-April2020), and then predict for september 2020

# The Next Pandemic:
	+ This is our model for what happened this time and why
	+ IF the next pandemic has similar attributes to this one, what happens?
